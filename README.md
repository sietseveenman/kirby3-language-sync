```

### Usage
Inside a blueprint.

```yml
fields:
  languageSync:
    type: sync
    buttonIcon: string or false # Overwrite the default button icon
    buttonLabel: string # Overwrite the default button text

### Additional notes
Any blueprint field with the option 'translate' is set to false will be excluded from the list of selectable fields to synchronize.

This plugin hasn't been battle tested much. Use on production projects at your own risk.
